        <p> In the Southern Hemisphere, the “winter” holidays fall during the summer. Australian temperatures can get as warm as 84 degrees Fahrenheit around Christmas. So naturally, many Australians head to the beach. Families and friends partake in swimming, picnics and volleyball. Often, some surfing Santas will make an appearance. A couple of Sydney beaches are known to be a hotspot for foreign travelers and backpackers. In recent years the wild parties thrown there have gotten so out of hand that alcohol bans have been implemented.</p>

      <p> Christmas trees are popular in Greece, but you’ll also find boats wrapped in strings of lights, whether in the water or in the main square. There are two explanations for the boat-decorating phenomenon: The first is that the country’s ancient maritime tradition means boats have always been an integral part of the culture, so they were decorated long before a modernized version of Christmas came along. The second is that St. Nicholas is considered the patron saint of sailors,which is why boats are decorated on December 6th.</p>

        <p> Winter Solstice is an ancient tradition — possibly dating as far back as the Stone Age — that observes the shortest day of the year. This occurs a few days before Christmas, and even though it’s celebrated in different forms everywhere from Sweden to Iran, England's Stonehenge is thought to be one of the earliest epicenters for marking the longest night of the year due to the placement of the stones. In fact, the Winter Solstice is still celebrated at Stonehenge, and anyone can buy tickets to experience the sunrise, along with Druid and Pagan traditions.</p>
